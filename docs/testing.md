# Testing

Feature tests run against a real MySQL/MariaDB database via [Pest](https://pestphp.com/). Set the
`DB_*_TEST` variables in `.env` (see `.env.example`), then:

```bash
composer test            # wipes + re-migrates the test DB, then runs the suite
composer test:coverage   # same, with a coverage report (requires Xdebug or PCOV)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs the same suite on every push/PR against both MySQL and MariaDB.
